						<h1>Differentiating Assessments</h1>
						<p>This trimester, I have two sections of English 12B, the last English class that graduating seniors must take. In planning and enacting my first unit, I found that my two sections were very different from each other in motivation, engagement, and prior knowledge. Over the course of the first week, I saw many of my students struggling to write a thesis statement that was clear, specific, and direct with regard to the arguments they were trying to make. Others, however, were writing strong thesis statements and were ready to move onto something new. In analyzing the thesis statements and case paragraphs they wrote, I was able to find the primary issues that many students were running into, both those who were not yet meeting my expectations and those who were. This data helped me to design separate tests for each of my sections with different focuses for each. The class with students who came to my class with more prior knowledge in writing analytical paragraphs was given a final assessment that asked them to use another analytical reading strategy that deepened their understanding of the text. The class with students who were struggling more with writing these analytical paragraphs was given a final assessment that focused on the primary goal of the unit, writing a strong argument. I also designed a thesis prewriting portion that this class became familiar with a few days before the final assessment.</p>
						<object width="900" height="1150" data="images/Skills-Based-Exam-1.pdf" type="application/pdf"></object>
						<p>This is the final assessment given to students who were already meeting my expectations and needed more of a challenge. They were asked to choose either “Paraphrase 3x” or “Analytical Summary” as part of their exam. Students in this class had much practice with both of these strategies because we were able to spend less time on scaffolding up to thesis statements and more time on going deeper into a text.</p>

						<p>This is the final assessment given to students who needed more scaffolds in order to meet my expectations and learn analytical reading skills. The focus of this test was primarily on the thesis statement and case paragraph portion, which we reviewed in depth during the days leading to the assessment. The prewriting section was created based on the questions that seemed to help students when I worked one-on-one with them.</p>

						<h1>Assessing Mastery In Multiple Ways</h1>
						<p>My English 9B class, a required course for all 9th grade students, is full of all different types of personalities. In order to get to know them better and to provide them an engaging way to show mastery in the skills we developed over the course of our short story unit, I designed this micro story assignment. While students were also assessed on their ability to identify and analyze elements of fiction in published works, I wanted to give them the opportunity to try using these elements in their own writing. Many of my students describe themselves as artistic, and I can see it in the way they complete their work; this assignment allowed them to express themselves while still incorporating the things they have been learning into their work. My favorite part about this assignment was circulating around the room as students began brainstorming because I was able to talk to them about why they chose a particular tone or why they wanted to write their story from a certain point-of-view. This gave me a look at how my students think in a more creative sense and helped me get to know them better as the trimester kicked off.</p>
						<object width="900" height="1150" data="images/Micro-Story-Assignment.pdf" type="application/pdf"></object>
						<p>This is the assignment description and rubric for the micro story assignment. It explains the purpose of the assignment and the requirements of the story, but it leaves the topic up to the writer!</p>
						<object width="900" height="1150" data="images/Micro-Story-Prewriting.pdf" type="application/pdf"></object>
						<p>This is the prewriting assignment that allowed students to organize their thoughts before they began writing. They were also encouraged to engage in brainstorming activities such as writing a character sketch, describing a setting in great detail, and listing things that are important to them./p>

						<h1>Balancing Instruction</h1>
						<p>In all of my classes, I have found that the best way for students to learn is to get them involved in the learning process. Sometimes, I find it necessary to do explicit instruction, but I make sure that all of my lessons are balanced. In the following examples, students were asked to write, discuss, or think about the topic at hand throughout the entire lesson. These activities guided their learning and helped them to become engaged in the lesson rather than simply listening to me explain things as I see them. Inviting student voice into my lessons is a crucial element of the learning process as it brings in fresh perspectives and nuances that add to our learning.</p>
						<object width="900" height="1150" data="images/Figurative-Language.pdf" type="application/pdf"></object>
						<p>This slide deck was used in my 9th grade class to teach the students about a few types of figurative language. Students were asked to come up with their own similes, metaphors, and symbols in order to fully grasp how these devices worked. One of the highlights was our class’s new favorite simile: “happiness is as runny and easy to spread as an egg yolk!”</p>
						<object width="900" height="1150" data="images/Ethos-Logos-Pathos.pdf" type="application/pdf"></object>
						<p>This slide deck was used in my 12th grade class to review ethos, logos, and pathos with the students. After talking about each of the appeals, the students were able to analyze advertisements and look closely at how arguments are created. At the end, we did a close “read” of an advertisement that used all of the rhetorical appeals, leading the students to creating their own advertisements, too.</p>
